This project focuses on analyzing and predicting student depression using the Student Depression Dataset. The analysis was performed with Python, using data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning techniques.

Steps Performed:
Data Cleaning: Removed leading/trailing spaces in column names and checked for missing values.

Label Encoding: Converted categorical features into numerical format using LabelEncoder.

Correlation Analysis: Visualized feature correlations using a heatmap to identify patterns.

Feature and Target Selection: Selected relevant features and defined Depression as the target variable.

Train-Test Split: Divided the dataset into training and testing sets (80/20 split).

Feature Scaling: Standardized numerical values using StandardScaler.

Modeling:

Trained and evaluated a Logistic Regression model.

Trained and evaluated a Random Forest Classifier.

Evaluation Metrics: Used accuracy, classification report, and ROC-AUC score to assess model performance.

The aim of this project is to explore how well machine learning models can predict depression in students based on survey data, and to identify the key contributing factors.
